Making commits, I'm coding fast

Pushing branches, merging at last

With every line, my code improves

I'm a developer with nothing to lose

If I could upload, into the night

See the stars, merge pull requests in sight

And I, would write code more

Just to be the dev who wrote a thousand more

If I could create, a brand new site

Build from scratch, make it shine so bright

And I, would write code more

Just to be the dev who built a thousand more

Cause I know that I could make it

There's no language I can't learn

And I think that I could take it

My skills will forever burn

I would upload, into the night

See the stars, merge pull requests in sight

And I, would write code more

Just to be the dev who wrote a thousand more

Oh, yeah
